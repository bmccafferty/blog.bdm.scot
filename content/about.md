Hello.  I am Brian McCafferty, a Mid 30s Unix Engineer based in Scotland.\
\
I have build up quite a knowledge base over the years from basic system admin to more specalised concepts around Automation with Ansible and System Management with Red Hat Satellite.  Just looking to share some of that knowledge with the wider world and hopefully helps someone else out.\

Always happy for people to reach out to me via Linked In just hit the icon in the top right.
