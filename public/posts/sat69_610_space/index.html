  content="With the release of Satellite 6.10 there are some considerations for space for the migration. This is due to the removal of Mongo DB with the data being migrated into the postgres database and the migration of the pulp system from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.
If you are currently running Satellite 6.9 and wish to check the space requirements they are:
 Ensure you have double the currently used space in /var/lib/pulp/published/ available Ensure you have free space in /var/lib/pulp/media equivalent to the currently used space in /var/lib/pulp/content Ensure the mount for postgresql12 has the free space available equivalent to the currently used space in /var/lib/mongodb/  To help you check and understand these requirments I have created a simple bash script to check these requirements."

      <p>With the release of <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.10">Satellite 6.10</a> there are some considerations for space for the migration.  This is due to the removal of Mongo DB with the data being migrated into the postgres database and the migration of the pulp system from Pulp 2 to Pulp 3.</p>
<p>If you are currently running Satellite 6.9 and wish to check the space requirements they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure you have double the currently used space in /var/lib/pulp/published/ available</li>
<li>Ensure you have free space in /var/lib/pulp/media equivalent to the currently used space in /var/lib/pulp/content</li>
<li>Ensure the mount for postgresql12 has the free space available equivalent to the currently used space in /var/lib/mongodb/</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you check and understand these requirments I have created a simple bash script to check these requirements.</p>
<p>The script can be run on a Satellite 6.9 Server to let you know the required space requirements and if your server currently meets these requirements.</p>
<p>To run the script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log On to your Satellite Server</li>
<li><code>sudo -i # to gain root</code></li>
<li><code>curl -o 610_upgrade_space_check.sh https://people.redhat.com/~bmccaffe/scripts/610_upgrade_space_check.sh</code></li>
<li><code>chmod +x 610_upgrade_space_check.sh</code></li>
<li><code>./610_upgrade_space_check.sh</code></li>
<li>Review outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample of the output from a test machine is below:</p>
<pre><code>root@sat6 ~]# ./610_upgrade_space_check.sh
Checking Migration State for ETA of migration
Running Retrieve Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration statistics
================================================================================
Retrieve Pulp 2 to Pulp 3 migration statistics:
============Migration Summary================
Migrated/Total RPMs: 0/151398
Migrated/Total errata: 0/27391
Migrated/Total repositories: 0/34
Estimated migration time based on yum content: 1 hours, 34 minutes

Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for /var/lib/pulp/published to double in size before starting the migration process.
Check the size of /var/lib/pulp/published with 'du -sh /var/lib/pulp/published/'

Note: ensure there is sufficient storage space for postgresql.
You will need additional space for your postgresql database.  The partition holding '/var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql12/lib/pgsql/data/'
   will need additional free space equivalent to the size of your Mongo db database (/var/lib/mongodb/).
                                                                      [OK]
